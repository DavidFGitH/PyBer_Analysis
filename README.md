# PyBer_Analysis
Ride-Sharing with Matplotlib

## Overview of Project

To take the ride-sharing data of Pyber and create an analysis grouped by city type investigating factors like weekly total fare and average fares.

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to provide an analysis on the effect of city type on factors such as number of rides, drivers and fares, while also visualizing the total weekly fares for each city type across a period of time.

## Results

Looking at the data shows that the total rides, drivers and fares in rural areas are dwarfed by the number in suburban and urban city types. In fact, the numbers of rides, drivers and fares in suburban type cities more than those of rural cities, which is followed by urban city numbers in the same factors more than doubling those of suburban cities. But although it can be said the market is bigger for urban and suburban cities, it comes with lower average fares per ride and lover average fares per driver. Plus, although the average fare per ride decreases gradually moving from rural to suburban to urban, there is a significant decrease in the average fare per driver with the same transition. Looking at the data summary, we can clearly see that number of city drivers outnumber the number of rides, meaning that there is an excess of drivers who haven't given rides. Although we can't assume that there all drivers have had rides for suburban and rural cities, clearly the ratio of the number rides compared to number of drivers decreases from rural to urban. It can also be assumed that people are paying more per ride in rural areas due to longer distances.

With the graph, the clearest conclusion we can make is that the total weekly fare is the highest for urban cities, followed by suburban and then rural. Other than that, more data and context would probably be needed to see if they all follow similar trends over time, etc. We can see that there is never an instance where any of the weekly fare of rural exceeds suburban, or suburban exceeds urban respectively. There are cases where we can see all types of cities following similar trends but more analysis would need to be made to see if this is conclusive.

## Summary

Clearly we can see that there the market gets larger as the we get to more denser city types. However, with this increased density, comes an increase in the supply of drivers leading to the least fare per driver in the urban cities. The biggest priority would be to take advantage of the larger market of urban cities, but that comes with an even larger supply of drivers that needs to be addressed. Finding ways to either increase the number of rides or decrease the supply of drivers would be good focus for leveling the disparity in urban cities. As for the less population dense city types, even though there are fewer rides and total fares available, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver increases so finding ways to increase profit based on distance would help in those areas. Finally, going back to the larger market and number of rides in the urban cities, since we're assuming the lower fares means the distances aren't as long, plans could be made in urban areas to focus more on quantity of rides over plans focusing on the distance of rides. Other than that, more data would be needed over time to see if there were certain periods promotions could be made to try to increase revenue across the board for those dates.
